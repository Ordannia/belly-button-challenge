# belly-button-challenge

This visualization dashboard displays information on bacterial cultures found within belly buttons. Users can explore data on bacterial cultures per sample, demographic information and more. The interactive charts are built with D3.js and Plotly.

The data for this project comes from the samples.json file which was provided by the bootcamp.

An interactive dropdown, a bar chart, a bubble chart and a demographic information panel are all different features utilized in this project.

Javascript, D3.js, Plotly.js, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and GitHub Pages are the technologies used.

All code assembled by myself, Rebekkah Alexander, using class notes and ChatGPT.
